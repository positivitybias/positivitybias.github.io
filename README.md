## Positivity Bias

Positivity bias provides an overview of inspiring and hope-inducing developments from all around the world. Unbeknown to many, things of negative nature can have a significantly stronger effect on our psyche than positive things of equal intensity. The news we receive on a daily basis can lead to a skewed image of the state of the world and make us lose hope. Positivity Bias aims to make a small contribution to compensating for what sometimes feels like an overwhelming amount of negative news and show that there is evidence for hope.
